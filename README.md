# Triangle_Chess
This describes a Godot-based video game to play chess on a chess board that is based on the hexagonal chess board seen in CGP Grey's video "Can Chess with Hexagons?" That chessboard is revised by cutting each hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles. The piece movement for all pieces is thus changed. Needs AI or Multiplayer.
